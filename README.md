This repository contains my solutions to coding problems from LeetCode, automatically synced to GitHub. It serves as a personal archive to track my problem-solving journey and growth in data structures and algorithms.

The solutions cover a variety of topics including arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms. Each solution reflects my approach to writing clean, optimized, and well-structured code. Over time, this repository will grow to include different difficulty levels — Easy, Medium, and Hard — showcasing consistent practice and improvement.

The main goals of this repository are:

To build and maintain a structured collection of LeetCode solutions.

To strengthen my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills.

To use this repo as a reference for interview preparation and competitive programming.

To share my progress with the developer community.

This repository may also include multiple programming languages, depending on the problem requirements and experimentation. Each commit corresponds to a specific solved problem, making it easy to track the learning path and revisit past solutions for optimization.

Note: This is a personal learning project. The solutions are based on my understanding and may not always represent the most optimal or official approach. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
